# SiSaNA
Single Sample Network Analysis

SiSaNA is used both before and after creating both Panda and Lioness networks from the package netZooPy. SiSaNA first needs to pre-process the data to be ran in PANDA/LIONESS. SiSaNA takes the Lioness output, processes it to be analyzed downstream, and then calculates in- and out-degree for each of the reconstructed networks. Additionally, it can compare the expression/degree between groups of interest, including performing statistical tests, visualizing the results (volcano plots, boxplots, and violin plots), and compare the survival between groups.

**Note: The steps below are for the basic use of SiSaNA. There are other functionalities across different scripts that are not covered in this file.**

## Requirements
 - python v3.12.0
 - cloned repo of netZooPy (https://github.com/netZoo/netZooPy/tree/master)
   
## Installation can be performed one of two ways...

### Using the "requirements.txt" file
1. Create a conda virtual environment with python 3.12.0
```
conda create --prefix /path/to/env-name python=3.12.0
```
2. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/newmanno/sisana.git
```
3. Run the following command to install the required modules
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### ...or installing from the included .yml file
```
conda env create --file sisana_conda_env.yml --prefix /path/to/env-name
```

## Pipeline overview

## Pre-processing of data
This step is actually performed prior to running Panda/Lioness, and it filters the expression matrix, PPI file, and prior motif to contain the same genes/TFs, which is necessary for running Panda/Lioness.

#### Usage
```
python filter_exp_min_samps.py -e <expression_file.tsv> -m <motif_file.txt> -p <ppi_file.txt> -n 10
```

#### Inputs
 - `-e`: Path to file containing the gene expression data. Row names must be genes, the expression file does not have a header, and the cells are separated by a tab
 - `-m`: Path to motif file, which gets filtered to only contain genes that pass the minimum number of samples threshold
 - `-p`: Path to ppi file, which gets filtered to only contain genes that pass the minimum number of samples threshold
 - `-n`: Minimum number of samples a gene must be expressed in; expression data will be filtered for only genes that pass

#### Outputs
Three files, one for each of the three filtered input files. 


## Run PANDA
This step creates a Panda network from the filtered files. See documentation for netZooPy (https://github.com/netZoo/netZooPy/tree/master). An example command is given below.

#### Usage
```
python run_panda.py -e <expression_data_filtered>.txt -m <motif_data_filtered>.txt -p <ppi_data_filtered>.txt -r True -o <output_file>.txt
```


## Run LIONESS
Similar to the PANDA step, this step creates Lioness networks from the filtered files. See documentation for netZooPy (https://github.com/netZoo/netZooPy/tree/master). An example command is given below.

#### Usage
```
python run_lioness.py -e <expression_data_filtered>.txt -m <motif_data_filtered>.txt -p <ppi_data_filtered>.txt -g cpu -r single -c 4 -o ./output/ -f mat
```


## Serialize the LIONESS output
We now save the lioness output as a pickle file

#### Usage
```
python lioness_to_pickle_df.py -p <file>.pickle -o <output directory>
```

#### Inputs
 - `-p`: Path to pickle file created by lioness_to_pickle_df.py script
 - `-o`: Path to directory to save output file to

#### Outputs
A single file of the lioness data frame in .pickle format



## Reduce the number of decimal points (OPTIONAL)
Now, we reduce the number of decimal places in the output file to save on storage space.

#### Usage
```
python reduce_number_decimal_places.py -n <file>.csv -i <input file type> -o <output directory> -f <output file type> -d <number of decimal points>
```

#### Inputs
 - `-n`: Path to either the indegree/outdegree file from lioness_df_indeg_outdeg_calculator.py or the lioness output file
 - `-i`: File type of the input file (either pickle or csv)
 - `-o`: Path to directory to output file to
 - `-f`: File type of output file
 - `-d`: Number of decimal points to truncate the degrees to

#### Outputs
A single file with truncated indegree/outdegree measurements



## Calculating in-degree and out-degree of genes and TFs in lioness networks
Once the lioness networks are made, a simple analysis to do is to calculate the in- and out-degrees of the nodes in the network, which is done in this step.

#### Usage
```
python lioness_df_indeg_outdeg_calculator.py -p <panda_output>.txt -q <lioness_output>.txt -t <choice> -o <output directory>
```

#### Inputs
 - `-p`: Path to panda file created by run_panda.py
 - `-q`: Path to lioness file created by run_lioness.py OR the file with reduced number of decimal places from the last step
 - `-t`: File type of lioness input file (-q)
 - `-o`: Path to pickle file to output
   
#### Outputs
A single pickled lioness data frame



## Comparing the in-degrees and out-degrees between treatment groups
Then, one can compare the in- and out-degrees between two treatment groups, using either a Student's t-test or a Mann-Whitney test.

#### Usage
```
python compare_degrees.py -m <mapping_file>.csv -p <indegree/outdegree file>.csv -c high low -t mw -o <output directory>
```

#### Inputs
 - `-m`: Path to mapping file (csv) that maps samples (first column, no header) to groups (second column, no header)
 - `-p`: Path to csv file containing the degrees (in/out) of each node
 - `-c`: A list (two strings) of the groups in the mapping file to perform comparisons between
 - `-t`: Type of comparison to perform, either Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U 
 - `-o`: Path to directory to output file to

#### Outputs
A single csv file containing the input degree dataframe, as well as the p-values and adjusted p-values (FDR) for each gene
